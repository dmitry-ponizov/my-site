    text: <p>Having struggled with understanding how the Spotify OAuth flow works, I made the course I wish I could have had.</p><p>Unlike tutorials that only cover a few concepts and leave you with half-baked GitHub repositories, this course covers everything from explaining the principles of REST APIs to implementing Spotify's OAuth flow and fetching API data in a React app. By the end of the course, you’ll have an app deployed to the internet you can add to your portfolio.</p>
